!!! note "Internal Processes"
    Many [University of Nottingham] Software Development **Processes** are internal only, and so these **Processes** and the **Guidelines** that correspond to them are not detailed on this site.

    They may be found [here][Internal Docs] by authorised parties (such as the Product Centre Application Development team).

## What's not here?

The site is a work in progress, so some areas that you feel should have documentation may be planned for the future.

Notably, this site does **not** provide documentation for:

* Anything that should remain internal to the University.
    * Documentation for these things can be found on a private [internal docs] site.
* Documentation for individual applications produced by the University.
    * These applications should have general documentation contained within their source repositories.
        * On [Github] this documentation may be published as a Github Pages site.
        * Internally this documentation may be published on an [internal docs] site.
    * These applications may also have instance specific documentation which will be held internally to the University by the Service Management team.
