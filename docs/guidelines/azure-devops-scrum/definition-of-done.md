#Definition of Done 

Key to SCRUM teams is to have a clear Definition of Done – or DOD. 

It highlights the criteria that has to be met in order for a Product Backlog Item be marked as ‘Done’. Before any project starts, the DOD must be agreed by the Scrum Team (including Product Owner).  
 
The team should take the 5 compulsory DOD items and pick a minimum of 3 optional.   

##Compulsory DOD Items

- Acceptance Criteria of Product Owner are met   
- Azure DevOps updated - remaining hours for task(s) set to 0 and all sub-task(s) are closed  
- Code is commented and checked in source control  
- Code is Unit Tested  
- Peer reviewed and meets development coding standards  

##Optional DOD Items

- Functional Documentation ready  
- Unit tests written and passing  
- Deployed to Test Environment  
- Passed UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and signed off as meeting requirements  
- Component design created  
- Builds without errors
