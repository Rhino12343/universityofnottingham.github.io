!!! danger "Legacy Applications developed on Windows only"

You'll want to install the following:

* The latest stable [Visual Studio]
  * Enterprise edition
  * Licensing (MSDN)
    * You should have a MSDN Visual Studio Enterprise subscription - speak to a Team Lead for details
* Jetbrains Resharper (requires licensing - speak to a Senior Developer)
* **Optional** The latest stable [SQL Server Management Studio] (Current GA release)

!!! note "TODO - Guidance on what Visual Studio components to install"

You may find when you work on older applications you need earlier versions of Visual Studio, but we recommend installing these only when required.

You may also wish to install preview versions of .NET tooling, such as Visual Studio betas or release candidates, or previews of SSMS.
This is fine, but be cautious using preview versions, and always have the latest stable version installed as well.
